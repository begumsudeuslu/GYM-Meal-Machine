# GYM-Meal-Machine
The Gym Meal Machine is a Java-based console application that simulates a vending machine designed for gym-goers. This machine allows users to purchase different meals based on their calorie and nutritional needs. The system maintains a list of available meals, processes user selections, and updates inventory accordingly.

  - Load Meals: The system initializes with a set of predefined meals.
  - Display Menu: Users can view available meal options along with their prices and nutritional values.
  - Purchase Meals: Users can select and buy meals based on their preferences and available balance.
